# Grievance Timeline Rules

Critical deadlines that can make or break a grievance.

---

## Standard Grievance Time Limits

Most contracts have time limits like these (check your specific contract):

| Step | Who Acts | Typical Deadline |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| Filing Grievance | Employee/Union | 5-30 days from incident or knowledge |
| Step 1 Response | Supervisor | 5-10 days after grievance filed |
| Step 2 Appeal | Union | 5-10 days after Step 1 response |
| Step 2 Response | Management | 10-15 days after appeal |
| Step 3 Appeal | Union | 5-15 days after Step 2 response |
| Step 3 Response | HR/Labor Relations | 10-20 days after appeal |
| Arbitration Request | Union | 15-30 days after final response |

## When Does the Clock Start?

| Situation | Clock Starts When |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Discipline issued | Employee receives discipline |
| Contract violation | Employee knows or should have known |
| Pay error | Error appears on paycheck |
| Ongoing violation | Each occurrence restarts clock |
| Policy change | Policy is implemented |
| Denial of benefit | Denial is communicated |

---

## Continuing Violations

A **continuing violation** occurs each time the conduct happens:

| Type | Example | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| Single event | Suspension on Jan 1 | Clock starts Jan 1 |
| Continuing | Wrong pay rate every week | Each paycheck restarts clock |
| Ongoing denial | Denied overtime weekly | Each denial restarts clock |
| Policy applied | Policy enforced repeatedly | Each application restarts clock |

---

## Discovery Rule

Sometimes the clock doesn't start until the employee **discovers** the violation:

| Example | When Clock Starts |
|---------|-------------------|
| Pay error buried in paycheck | When employee notices or should have noticed |
| Secret discipline in file | When employee learns it exists |
| Hidden policy change | When employee is affected or learns of it |

---

## Calendar Days vs. Working Days

**Check your contract!**

| Type | How to Count | Example (5 days) |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| Calendar days | Include weekends/holidays | Mon-Sat |
| Working days | Exclude weekends/holidays | Mon-Fri, then next Mon |
| Business days | Same as working days | Exclude weekends/holidays |

---

## What Stops the Clock

These may pause or extend time limits:

| Situation | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Employer requests extension | Clock paused if union agrees |
| Union requests extension | Clock paused if employer agrees |
| Waiting for information | May pause clock (document!) |
| Settlement discussions | May pause clock (get in writing!) |
| Mutual agreement | Any agreed extension |

---

## What Happens If You Miss a Deadline

| Who Misses | Consequence |
|------------|-------------|
| Union misses filing deadline | Grievance may be dismissed |
| Union misses appeal deadline | Grievance may be considered withdrawn |
| Employer misses response deadline | May be deemed denied, proceed to next step |
| Employer misses response deadline | May waive right to object to timeliness |

---

## Timeliness Defense Strategies

If management claims grievance is untimely:

**Argument 1: Continuing Violation**
> "This is a continuing violation that occurs each time [action happens]. The most recent occurrence was [date], which is within the time limit."

**Argument 2: Discovery Rule**
> "The employee did not discover and could not reasonably have discovered this violation until [date]. The clock runs from discovery, not occurrence."

**Argument 3: Waiver**
> "Management responded to the grievance on its merits at Steps 1 and 2 without raising timeliness. They have waived the right to raise timeliness now."

**Argument 4: Estoppel**
> "Management's actions led the employee to believe no grievance was needed. They cannot now claim it is untimely."

## Protecting Yourself on Timeliness

| Action | Why It Helps |
|--------|--------------|
| File early | Better too early than too late |
| Get everything in writing | Prove when you filed/responded |
| Keep copies | Date-stamped copies prove timing |
| Document extensions | Get written agreement to any extensions |
| Object to late responses | Note if management misses deadlines |
| Reserve rights | "Without prejudice to timeliness arguments" |

---

## Discipline-Specific Timelines

Many contracts have special rules for discipline:

| Rule | Example |
|------|---------|
| Time to discipline | Must discipline within X days of learning of offense |
| Sunset clause | Discipline removed after 6-12 months |
| Review period | Employee can request review of discipline after X months |
| Probationary period | Different rules for new employees |

---

## Key NLRA Timelines

For unfair labor practice charges (NLRB):

| Action | Deadline |
|--------|----------|
| File ULP charge | 6 months from violation |
| NLRB investigation | Varies (typically 7-12 weeks) |
| Appeal NLRB decision | 14 days |

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | How to Avoid |
|---------|--------------|
| Counting wrong | Use a calendar, count carefully |
| Assuming weekends count | Check if contract says "working days" |
| Not documenting filing date | Get receipt or confirmation |
| Waiting for more information | File now, investigate later |
| Relying on verbal extensions | Get it in writing |
| Assuming employer will be late | Don't count on their mistakes |
