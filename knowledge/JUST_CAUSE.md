# The Seven Tests of Just Cause

These are the standard tests arbitrators use to determine if discipline was fair. If management fails ANY of these tests, the grievance should be won.

---

## Test 1: Notice

**Question:** Did the employer give the employee forewarning of the possible consequences of their conduct?

**What to look for:**
- Was there a written rule or policy?
- Was the employee told about the rule?
- Was the rule posted or in the employee handbook?
- For serious offenses (theft, violence), notice may be assumed

**Winning arguments:**
- "The employee was never informed of this policy"
- "The rule was not posted or communicated"
- "This is a new rule applied retroactively"

---

## Test 2: Reasonable Rule

**Question:** Was the employer's rule reasonably related to the orderly, efficient, and safe operation of the business?

**What to look for:**
- Does the rule make sense for this workplace?
- Is the rule too broad or vague?
- Does it serve a legitimate business purpose?

**Winning arguments:**
- "This rule has no connection to job performance"
- "The rule is so vague no reasonable person could follow it"
- "The rule is outdated and no longer serves a purpose"

---

## Test 3: Investigation

**Question:** Did the employer make an effort to discover whether the employee did in fact violate the rule?

**What to look for:**
- Did management investigate before disciplining?
- Were witnesses interviewed?
- Was the employee given a chance to explain?
- Was the investigation fair and thorough?

**Winning arguments:**
- "Management made no attempt to investigate"
- "The investigation was one-sided"
- "Key witnesses were never interviewed"
- "The employee's explanation was ignored"

---

## Test 4: Fair Investigation

**Question:** Was the investigation conducted fairly and objectively?

**What to look for:**
- Was the investigator neutral?
- Were all sides heard?
- Was evidence gathered properly?
- Was there a rush to judgment?

**Winning arguments:**
- "The investigator had already decided the outcome"
- "Exculpatory evidence was ignored"
- "The investigation was designed to confirm guilt, not find truth"

---

## Test 5: Proof

**Question:** Did the investigation produce substantial evidence of guilt?

**What to look for:**
- Is there actual proof, not just suspicion?
- Is the evidence reliable?
- Does the evidence support the charge?
- Is it "he said/she said" with no corroboration?

**Winning arguments:**
- "There is no proof the employee did this"
- "The evidence is circumstantial at best"
- "Management is relying on hearsay"
- "The accuser has credibility issues"

---

## Test 6: Equal Treatment

**Question:** Has the employer applied its rules and penalties evenhandedly?

**What to look for:**
- Have other employees done the same thing?
- What discipline did they receive?
- Is this employee being singled out?
- Are there disparities based on protected characteristics?

**Winning arguments:**
- "Employee X did the same thing and received no discipline"
- "This is selective enforcement"
- "Management has a history of treating this employee differently"
- "The policy has never been enforced before"

---

## Test 7: Penalty

**Question:** Was the degree of discipline reasonably related to the seriousness of the offense and the employee's record?

**What to look for:**
- Is the punishment too harsh for the offense?
- What is the employee's work history?
- How long have they been employed?
- Are there mitigating circumstances?

**Winning arguments:**
- "Termination is too severe for a first offense"
- "The employee has 15 years of clean record"
- "Progressive discipline was skipped"
- "Personal circumstances were not considered"

## How to Use These Tests

1. Go through each test one by one
2. Ask: "Did management pass this test?"
3. Document where they failed
4. Build your defense around the failures
5. The more tests failed, the stronger your case
