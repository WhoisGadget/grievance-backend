# Winning Arguments - Proven Defense Strategies

These are arguments that consistently win grievances. Use them as templates and customize for your case.

---

## Progressive Discipline Arguments

### "Progressive Discipline Was Not Followed"

> Management jumped directly to [termination/suspension] without following the progressive discipline steps outlined in Article [X] of the collective bargaining agreement. The employee had no prior discipline for this type of offense. The contract requires verbal warning, written warning, suspension, then termination. Management skipped directly to the final step.

**When to use:** First offense with severe punishment

---

### "The Discipline Record Was Stale"

> The prior discipline cited by management occurred [X] years ago and should not be considered under the contract's [X]-month sunset clause. Article [X] states that discipline older than [X] months cannot be used for progressive discipline purposes. Therefore, this should be treated as a first offense.

**When to use:** Old discipline being used against employee

---

## Disparate Treatment Arguments

### "Other Employees Treated Differently"

> Employee [A] committed the same offense on [date] and received only a verbal warning. Employee [B] did the same thing on [date] and received no discipline at all. The grievant is being singled out for harsher treatment without justification. This disparate treatment violates the principle of equal application of rules.

**When to use:** When you can prove others did the same thing

---

### "Rule Never Enforced Before"

> Management has never enforced this rule in the [X] years it has existed. Employees routinely [behavior] without consequence. Management cannot suddenly decide to enforce a dormant rule without first giving notice that enforcement will begin. This is "gotcha" discipline.

**When to use:** First enforcement of old rule

---

## Procedural Violation Arguments

### "Investigation Was Inadequate"

> Management failed to conduct a proper investigation before issuing discipline. Key witnesses were not interviewed. The employee was not given an opportunity to tell their side. Management relied solely on [supervisor's] account without corroboration. A fair investigation would have revealed [exculpatory facts].

**When to use:** Rush to judgment cases

---

### "Weingarten Rights Violated"

> The employee clearly requested union representation before the investigatory interview. This request was denied/ignored, and management continued questioning. Any statements made during this interview must be disregarded, and discipline based on those statements must be rescinded.

**When to use:** Representation denied

---

### "Timeliness Violation"

> Management failed to issue discipline within the [X]-day time limit specified in Article [X]. The incident occurred on [date], but discipline was not issued until [date], which is [X] days later. The contract time limits are mandatory, and untimely discipline is null and void.

**When to use:** Late discipline

---

## Mitigation Arguments

### "Long Service Record"

> The grievant has [X] years of service with the company and an excellent work record. In those [X] years, they have received [positive performance notes/awards/no prior discipline]. One incident should not erase a decade of dedicated service. The penalty should be reduced to account for this exemplary history.

**When to use:** Long-term employee with good record

---

### "Personal Circumstances"

> At the time of the incident, the employee was dealing with [medical condition/family emergency/documented stress]. While this does not excuse the behavior, it provides context that should have been considered as a mitigating factor. Management failed to consider these circumstances when determining the level of discipline.

**When to use:** Extenuating circumstances exist

---

### "First Offense"

> This is the grievant's first offense of this nature in their [X] years of employment. The concept of progressive discipline exists precisely for situations like this - to correct behavior through escalating consequences. Termination for a first offense defeats the purpose of progressive discipline.

**When to use:** Any first offense termination

---

## Evidence Arguments

### "Insufficient Proof"

> Management bears the burden of proof in discipline cases. The evidence presented consists solely of [description]. There is no documentation, no witnesses, and no physical evidence. "Because I said so" is not sufficient proof. The discipline must be overturned for lack of evidence.

**When to use:** Weak evidence cases

---

### "Hearsay Evidence"

> Management's case relies entirely on what [person] claims to have heard from [another person]. This is classic hearsay and is unreliable. The original source was not interviewed, and the grievant cannot confront their accuser. This evidence should be given no weight.

**When to use:** Secondhand accusations

---

### "Credibility Issues"

> The accuser, [name], has documented conflicts with the grievant and a motive to make false accusations. On [date], [accuser] [evidence of bias]. Their account should not be credited over the grievant's denial without corroborating evidence.

**When to use:** Biased accusers

---

## Contract Violation Arguments

### "Clear Contract Language"

> Article [X], Section [Y] states clearly that "[exact quote]." There is no ambiguity in this language. Management's action directly violates this provision. The contract must be enforced as written.

**When to use:** Black and white contract violations

---

### "Past Practice"

> For the past [X] years, this situation has been handled by [description of practice]. This is a well-established past practice known to both parties. Management cannot unilaterally change an established practice without bargaining. The past practice must be followed.

**When to use:** Established patterns exist

---

### "Management Rights Limited"

> While management has the right to [action], this right is limited by the collective bargaining agreement. Article [X] specifically requires [procedure/limitation]. Management cannot claim unfettered discretion when the contract imposes conditions.

**When to use:** Management overreach

---

## Remedy Arguments

### "Make Whole"

> The grievant must be made whole for all losses resulting from the improper [discipline/action]. This includes:
> - Full back pay from [date] to [date]
> - Restoration of seniority
> - Restoration of all benefits
> - Removal of discipline from personnel file
> - No break in service for any purpose

**When to use:** Termination cases

---

### "Expungement"

> Given that the discipline was improper, the written warning/record of discipline must be removed from the employee's personnel file and any other records. It would be unjust to allow an improper discipline to affect the employee's future.

**When to use:** Any successful grievance

---

### "Interest"

> Back pay should include interest at [X]% from the date wages were wrongfully withheld. The grievant should not suffer the time-value loss of money improperly withheld.

**When to use:** Monetary grievances

---

## Combination Templates

### Strong Termination Defense

> 1. Progressive discipline was not followed (no prior discipline)
> 2. Investigation was inadequate (witnesses not interviewed)
> 3. Evidence is insufficient (hearsay only)
> 4. Disparate treatment (Employee X did same thing, kept job)
> 5. Long service record ignored (15 years, no prior issues)
>
> For these reasons, the termination must be reversed and the grievant made whole.

### Strong Contract Violation Defense

> 1. Contract language is clear (Article X requires Y)
> 2. Past practice confirms interpretation (always done this way)
> 3. Management knew the rule (training records show)
> 4. Grievant suffered harm (lost overtime/pay/opportunity)
>
> The remedy must include restoration and back pay.
