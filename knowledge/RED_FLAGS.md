# Red Flags - Weak Management Arguments

When management uses these arguments, they're often on shaky ground. Know how to counter them.

---

## Discipline Red Flags

### "Zero Tolerance Policy"

**Why it's weak:**
- Arbitrators generally reject zero tolerance as inconsistent with just cause
- Progressive discipline still applies
- Context always matters

**Counter:**
> "Zero tolerance policies cannot override the just cause standard. Each case must be evaluated on its own facts. Arbitrators consistently reject automatic penalties that ignore individual circumstances."

---

### "We Have to Send a Message"

**Why it's weak:**
- Discipline is for correction, not example-making
- Using one employee to scare others is improper
- Penalty must fit THIS employee's offense

**Counter:**
> "The purpose of discipline is to correct behavior, not to 'send messages' to other employees. Using the grievant as an example is improper and results in a penalty disproportionate to the offense."

---

### "They Should Have Known Better"

**Why it's weak:**
- Assumes facts not in evidence
- Actual notice is required for most offenses
- Training records may show otherwise

**Counter:**
> "The burden is on management to prove the employee was aware of the rule. There is no evidence of training, posted policies, or prior instruction on this issue."

---

### "They Admitted It"

**Why it's weak:**
- Admission doesn't mean discipline is justified
- Context of admission matters
- May have been coerced or misunderstood

**Counter:**
> "Even if the conduct occurred, the question is whether the discipline was appropriate. Admission is not a waiver of the right to challenge the penalty."

---

### "We Had No Choice"

**Why it's weak:**
- Management always has choices
- Lesser discipline is always an option
- Past practice may show other choices were made

**Counter:**
> "Management had several options, including progressive discipline. The claim of 'no choice' is contradicted by [examples of alternative actions taken in similar cases]."

---

## Investigation Red Flags

### "We Believe the Supervisor"

**Why it's weak:**
- Supervisors are not automatically more credible
- May have bias or motive
- Corroboration should exist

**Counter:**
> "The supervisor is not a neutral party and has an interest in the outcome. Without corroborating evidence, one person's account should not override another's denial."

---

### "The Employee Didn't Deny It"

**Why it's weak:**
- Silence is not admission
- Employee may have been advised to remain silent
- Weingarten rights protect silence

**Counter:**
> "The employee's silence during questioning cannot be held against them. They have no obligation to assist in building a case against themselves."

---

### "We Investigated Thoroughly"

**Why it's weak:**
- Often just means they reached a conclusion
- May not have interviewed key witnesses
- May not have considered employee's side

**Counter:**
> "A thorough investigation would have included [interviews with X, review of Y, consideration of Z]. None of these steps were taken."

---

## Procedure Red Flags

### "The Contract Doesn't Specifically Prohibit This"

**Why it's weak:**
- Just cause applies regardless
- Past practice may establish limits
- Implied terms exist

**Counter:**
> "The just cause provision applies to all discipline, regardless of whether a specific rule is written. Management cannot take arbitrary action simply because the contract doesn't explicitly prohibit it."

---

### "This Is a Management Right"

**Why it's weak:**
- Management rights are limited by the contract
- Just cause still applies
- Other provisions may control

**Counter:**
> "Management rights are not unlimited. They are constrained by Article [X] regarding just cause, Article [Y] regarding seniority, and the implied covenant of good faith."

---

### "We're Just Following Policy"

**Why it's weak:**
- Policy can't override contract
- Policy may not have been bargained
- Policy may be applied inconsistently

**Counter:**
> "Company policy cannot override the collective bargaining agreement. Where the two conflict, the contract controls."

---

## Evidence Red Flags

### "Everyone Knows They Did It"

**Why it's weak:**
- Rumor is not evidence
- Must prove, not assume
- May be based on bias

**Counter:**
> "Workplace gossip and assumptions are not evidence. Management has the burden to prove the offense with actual evidence, not general beliefs."

---

### "The Video/Recording Shows..."

**Why it's weak:**
- Video can be ambiguous
- Context may be missing
- May not show what they claim

**Counter:**
> "The video should be reviewed in its entirety, not selectively edited. [Specific issues with the footage]. The recording does not prove what management claims."

---

### "They Have a History"

**Why it's weak:**
- Prior discipline may be expired
- Must judge this incident on its own
- Prior incidents may be different

**Counter:**
> "Prior discipline older than [sunset period] cannot be considered. Additionally, past issues of a different nature are not relevant to the current charge."

---

## Disparate Treatment Red Flags

### "This Case Is Different"

**Why it's weak:**
- Often a way to justify inconsistency
- Differences may be trivial
- May hide actual discrimination

**Counter:**
> "The claimed differences are not material. Employee [X] committed the same essential offense and received [lesser discipline]. The grievant is being singled out."

---

### "We Can't Discuss Other Employees"

**Why it's weak:**
- Union has right to comparator information
- Privacy does not override grievance rights
- May be hiding inconsistency

**Counter:**
> "The union is entitled to information about how similar cases were handled to evaluate disparate treatment. This information is necessary for fair representation."

---

### "We're Being More Consistent Now"

**Why it's weak:**
- Can't start with this employee
- Must give notice of change
- Past practice is binding

**Counter:**
> "If management wishes to change its enforcement practices, it must do so prospectively and provide notice. The grievant cannot be the first example of new enforcement."

---

## Remedy Red Flags

### "They Don't Deserve Back Pay"

**Why it's weak:**
- If discipline was wrong, back pay is required
- Make-whole is the standard remedy
- Windfall arguments fail

**Counter:**
> "The grievant was wrongfully terminated and is entitled to be made whole. Back pay is the standard remedy and cannot be denied simply because management disagrees."

---

### "They Found Another Job"

**Why it's weak:**
- Mitigation is an offset, not a bar
- Duty to mitigate is limited
- Back pay still owed

**Counter:**
> "Interim earnings are properly offset against back pay, but they do not eliminate the obligation to make the employee whole."

---

### "It's Been Too Long"

**Why it's weak:**
- Management often causes delay
- Delay doesn't eliminate violation
- Laches rarely applies

**Counter:**
> "Any delay in resolution was caused by management's refusal to settle at earlier steps. The grievant should not be penalized for pursuing their rights through the grievance process."
