## Example 1: Termination for Attendance

### Case Summary
Employee terminated for excessive absenteeism after missing 8 days in 6 months. Employee had FMLA-qualifying condition.

### Defense Packet

**GRIEVANCE DEFENSE PACKET**

**Grievant:** John Smith
**Employee ID:** 12345
**Classification:** Machine Operator
**Seniority Date:** March 15, 2015
**Date of Discharge:** January 10, 2025
**Steward:** Jane Doe

---

**STATEMENT OF GRIEVANCE**

The Company violated the Collective Bargaining Agreement by terminating John Smith without just cause on January 10, 2025.

---

**FACTS**

1. John Smith has been employed with the Company for nearly 10 years
2. He was terminated for "excessive absenteeism" - 8 absences in 6 months
3. 5 of the 8 absences were FMLA-protected for a documented medical condition
4. The remaining 3 absences were for the same medical condition but occurred before FMLA was approved
5. Mr. Smith has no prior discipline for attendance in his 10-year career
6. He received "Meets Expectations" or better on all performance reviews

---

**CONTRACT VIOLATIONS**

**Article 5 - Just Cause**
The Company failed to meet the just cause standard:

1. **Notice:** The attendance policy does not distinguish between protected and unprotected absences
2. **Progressive Discipline:** No prior warnings were issued for attendance
3. **Equal Treatment:** Employee Mary Jones had 12 absences last year and received only a verbal warning
4. **Penalty:** Termination is excessive for a first attendance offense

**Article 12 - Leave of Absence**
FMLA-protected absences cannot be counted against an employee for discipline purposes. Five of eight absences were FMLA-protected, leaving only 3 absences - well below any threshold for termination.

---

**SIMILAR CASES**

- *ABC Manufacturing, 2022*: Termination reduced to warning where employee had no prior discipline
- *XYZ Industries, 2021*: Discharge overturned when FMLA absences were counted in total
- *Midwest Products, 2023*: Disparate treatment found when other employees had worse attendance

---

**REMEDY REQUESTED**

1. Reinstatement to former position with full seniority
2. Full back pay from January 10, 2025 to date of reinstatement
3. Restoration of all benefits
4. Removal of termination from personnel file
5. No break in service for any purpose

---

## Example 2: Suspension for Insubordination

### Case Summary
Employee received 5-day suspension for "refusing a direct order" to work overtime. Employee had childcare obligations.

### Defense Packet

**GRIEVANCE DEFENSE PACKET**

**Grievant:** Maria Garcia
**Employee ID:** 67890
**Classification:** Customer Service Representative
**Seniority Date:** June 1, 2019
**Date of Suspension:** December 15, 2024
**Steward:** Bob Williams

---

**STATEMENT OF GRIEVANCE**

The Company violated Article 7 (Just Cause) and Article 15 (Overtime) by suspending Maria Garcia for 5 days without just cause.

---

**FACTS**

1. On December 15, Supervisor Tom Brown ordered Ms. Garcia to work 4 hours overtime
2. Ms. Garcia explained she had childcare pickup at 5:00 PM with no alternative arrangements
3. She offered to work overtime the following day or any other day that week
4. Supervisor Brown refused and marked her as "refusing overtime"
5. Three other employees on shift were not asked to work overtime
6. Ms. Garcia has no prior discipline in her 5+ years of employment

---

**CONTRACT VIOLATIONS**

**Article 7 - Just Cause**

1. **Reasonable Rule:** Requiring overtime with no notice and refusing a reasonable alternative is not reasonable
2. **Investigation:** No one asked if other employees could work instead
3. **Equal Treatment:** Three other employees were not asked before discipline was issued
4. **Penalty:** 5-day suspension for a first offense of this nature is excessive

**Article 15 - Overtime, Section 3**
"Overtime shall be distributed as equally as practicable among qualified employees."

The Company failed to offer overtime to other available employees before demanding compliance from Ms. Garcia.

**Article 15 - Overtime, Section 5**
"Employees shall be given reasonable notice of required overtime when practicable."

No advance notice was given. The demand came at 4:30 PM for immediate overtime.

---

**PAST PRACTICE**

For the past three years, employees who decline overtime due to personal emergencies have been excused without discipline, including:
- Tom Anderson (December 2023) - family emergency
- Sue Chen (March 2024) - medical appointment
- James Wilson (August 2024) - childcare issue

None received discipline. Ms. Garcia is being treated differently.

---

**REMEDY REQUESTED**

1. Rescind the 5-day suspension
2. Make Ms. Garcia whole for lost wages (5 days x 8 hours x hourly rate)
3. Remove all references to this incident from her personnel file
4. Cease and desist from disparate treatment

---

## Example 3: Contract Violation - Seniority Bypass

### Case Summary
Senior employee bypassed for overtime in favor of junior employee.

### Defense Packet

**GRIEVANCE DEFENSE PACKET**

**Grievant:** Robert Johnson
**Employee ID:** 11111
**Classification:** Warehouse Worker
**Seniority Date:** February 1, 2010
**Date of Violation:** November 20, 2024
**Steward:** Carol Martinez

---

**STATEMENT OF GRIEVANCE**

The Company violated Article 15 (Overtime) by bypassing senior employee Robert Johnson for overtime work on November 20, 2024.

---

**FACTS**

1. On November 20, 2024, 4 hours of overtime were available in the Shipping Department
2. The overtime was assigned to Mike Brown, seniority date August 15, 2022
3. Robert Johnson, seniority date February 1, 2010, was available and qualified
4. Mr. Johnson was not offered the overtime opportunity
5. The overtime equalization list shows Mr. Johnson is owed 12 hours compared to Mr. Brown

---

**CONTRACT VIOLATION**

**Article 15 - Overtime, Section 1**
"Overtime shall be offered to employees in the classification by seniority."

This language is clear and unambiguous. Mr. Johnson has 12 years more seniority than Mr. Brown. He should have been offered the overtime first.

**Article 15 - Overtime, Section 2**
"The Company shall maintain an overtime equalization list and make reasonable efforts to equalize overtime opportunities."

The overtime list shows Mr. Johnson is already owed 12 hours. Assigning overtime to Mr. Brown increases this disparity.

---

**REMEDY REQUESTED**

1. Pay Mr. Johnson for 4 hours at the overtime rate as if he had worked the shift
2. Adjust the overtime equalization list to reflect this payment
3. Cease and desist from bypassing senior employees for overtime
