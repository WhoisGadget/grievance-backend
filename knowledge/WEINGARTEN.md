# Weingarten Rights

These rights come from a 1975 Supreme Court case (NLRB v. J. Weingarten, Inc.) and protect union members during investigatory interviews.

---

## The Basic Right

**An employee has the right to have a union representative present during any investigatory interview that the employee reasonably believes could lead to discipline.**

---

## When Weingarten Rights Apply

| Situation | Rights Apply? |
|-----------|---------------|
| Meeting could lead to discipline | YES |
| "Just a conversation" but feels like investigation | YES |
| Being asked about your own conduct | YES |
| Being asked about coworker's conduct | YES |
| Being asked to write a statement | YES |
| Normal work instructions | NO |
| Delivering discipline (not investigating) | NO |
| Safety investigations (sometimes) | MAYBE |

---

## What the Employee Must Do

1. **Ask for representation** - The employee must REQUEST a steward
2. **The employer is NOT required to remind them** of this right
3. **The request can be verbal** - "I want my steward here"

---

## What Happens After the Request

The employer has THREE options:

| Option | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| 1. Grant the request | Stop and get a steward |
| 2. End the interview | No discipline based on this interview |
| 3. Give a choice | "You can have a steward or we end this now" |

**The employer CANNOT:**
- Continue the interview without a steward
- Discipline the employee for requesting representation
- Pressure the employee to waive their rights

---

## The Steward's Role

Once in the meeting, the steward CAN:

| Allowed | Not Allowed |
|---------|-------------|
| Ask for clarification | Answer for the employee |
| Request a caucus (private talk) | Disrupt the meeting |
| Take notes | Instruct employee not to answer |
| Advise the employee | Turn it into a grievance meeting |
| Object to improper questions | Be abusive or threatening |
| Witness what is said | Physically interfere |

---

## The Weingarten Statement

Employees can read this when requesting a steward:

> "If this discussion could in any way lead to my being disciplined or terminated, I respectfully request that my union representative be present at this meeting. Until my representative arrives, I choose not to participate in this discussion."

---

## Violations and Remedies

If management violates Weingarten rights:

| Violation | Remedy |
|-----------|--------|
| Continued interview without steward | Statements may be thrown out |
| Discipline based on tainted interview | Discipline may be overturned |
| Retaliation for requesting steward | Unfair labor practice charge |

---

## Key Points for Stewards

1. **Get there fast** - Don't give management an excuse to proceed
2. **Find out what it's about** - Before the meeting if possible
3. **Take detailed notes** - Who, what, when, where
4. **Don't let the employee dig a hole** - Request caucuses when needed
5. **Object to leading questions** - "That's a loaded question"
6. **Document violations** - Note if rights were denied

## Common Management Tricks

| Trick | How to Counter |
|-------|----------------|
| "This isn't an investigation" | If it feels like one, it is |
| "You don't need a steward" | That's the employee's choice |
| "We're just having a chat" | Request representation anyway |
| "If you have nothing to hide..." | Irrelevant, rights still apply |
| "This will go faster without a steward" | Rights don't have a speed limit |
| "We'll just reschedule" | Fine, that's their choice |

## State and Private Sector Notes

- **Private sector:** Weingarten rights apply (NLRA)
- **Public sector:** Depends on state law and contract
- **Non-union:** Weingarten rights do NOT apply (IBM decision)

---

## Quick Reference Card

**Employee says:** "I want my union rep."

**Management must:**
1. Stop questioning, OR
2. End the meeting, OR
3. Offer to continue without discipline

**Management cannot:**
- Keep questioning
